## Credit Cards

Credit cards allow cardholders to borrow funds up to a predetermined limit for the purpose of making purchases, withdrawing cash, or transferring balances. The funds borrowed are to be repaid later on a monthly basis, and interest is charged on the outstanding balance that remains unpaid after the due date.

### Common Characteristics

- Issued as secured cards with collateral or as unsecured cards based on creditworthiness.
- Credit limit is up to three times the income or 80-90% of the collateral.
- Credit limit can be used for purchases, cash withdrawals, or balance transfers to other accounts.
- Interest-free period of up to 55-57 days (comprising a standard 30-day billing cycle and a 25-to-27-day grace period).
- Minimum payment is required each billing cycle.
- Late fee is applied if the minimum payment not made by the due date.
- Interest is charged on any remaining balance after the grace period ends.
- Supplementary cards with controlled limits can be issued.
- Purchases and cash withdrawals can be repaid in installments at a lower interest rate.

## Debit Cards

Debit cards are linked to cardholdersâ€™ current or savings accounts, allowing them to make withdrawals, deposits, transfers, and purchases. Unlike credit cards, which extend a line of credit, debit cards do not provide cardholders with the option of deferring payment. Instead, transactions are processed immediately, debiting the amounts withdrawn, transferred, or used for purchases directly from the linked accounts with no interest charged.

### Common Characteristics

- No collateral or credit checks required.
- Linked to current accounts or savings accounts.
- Used for withdrawals, deposits, transfers, and purchases.
- Amounts withdrawn, transferred, or used for purchases are directly debited from the linked accounts with no interest charged.
- Additional accounts can be linked to the primary account, and transfers can be made across them via automated teller machines (ATMs).
- Supplementary cards with controlled limits can be issued.
- Low issuance and renewal fees.

## Prepaid Cards

Prepaid cards are preloaded by cardholders with a specific amount of funds, which can be used to make purchases or withdraw cash. Prepaid cards are not linked to bank accounts and do not extend a line of credit. Instead, transactions are limited to the available balance loaded onto the cards, and the amounts withdrawn or used for purchases are directly debited from the cards with no interest charged.

### Common Characteristics

- No bank accounts, collateral, or credit checks required.
- Available to minors (individuals below the statutory age of majority).
- Can be issued instantly.
- Used for withdrawals, deposits, and purchases.
- Amounts withdrawn or used for purchases are directly debited from the cards with no interest charged.
- Low issuance and renewal fees.
