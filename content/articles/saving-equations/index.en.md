## Saving = Disposable Income – Consumption

This equation delineates that saving is equal to disposable income minus consumption. It articulates the relationship whereby the portion of an individual’s disposable income that is not expended on consumption is accumulated as savings. Disposable income represents the amount of money an individual has available after income taxes, and consumption comprises expenses on goods and services. Thus, any remaining income after these expenses contributes to savings.

## Disposable Income = Total Income – Income Taxes

This equation defines disposable income as the difference between total income and income taxes. It conveys that disposable income is the net amount of earnings an individual retains after subtracting the total amount paid in income taxes. Total income includes all sources of income such as wages, salaries, bonuses, and any other monetary earnings. Income taxes are the taxes levied by the government on these earnings.

## Disposable Income = Consumption + Saving

This equation describes disposable income as the sum of consumption and saving. It underscores the allocation of disposable income into two primary components: consumption, which pertains to spending on goods and services, and saving, which refers to the portion of income not spent and reserved for future use. This relationship highlights the entirety of disposable income being distributed across immediate expenditures and future savings.

## Discretionary Income = Disposable Income – Necessary Expenditure

This equation explicates that discretionary income is the amount of disposable income remaining after deducting necessary expenditures. Discretionary income thus represents the funds available for non-essential expenditures or savings after covering all obligatory expenses. Necessary expenditures typically include costs required for basic living such as rent, utilities, and groceries, whereas discretionary income may be saved or spent on leisure activities, or luxury purchases.
