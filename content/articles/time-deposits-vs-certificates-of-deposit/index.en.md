## Common Characteristics Shared between Time Deposits and Certificates of Deposit (CDs)

- Minimum purchase amount required.
- Fixed or variable interest rate.
- Interest is accrued from the business day following the day of purchase.
- Interest payments can be made at different frequencies (monthly, quarterly, semi-annually, annually, or at maturity).
- Can be redeemed prior to maturity either fully or partially, with a partial loss of interest.
- Can be used as collateral for borrowing.
- Secured credit cards can be issued against them.

## Common Differences between Time Deposits and Certificates of Deposit (CDs)

### Term

The term of time deposits ranges from seven days to seven years, whereas the term of certificates of deposit (CDs) ranges from three years to ten years.

### Interest Posting

Interest accrued from time deposits can be added to the deposits, current accounts, or savings accounts, whereas interest accrued from certificates of deposit (CDs) can be added to current accounts or savings accounts only.

### Early Redemption

Time deposits can be redeemed prior to maturity either fully or partially at any time, whereas certificates of deposit (CDs) cannot be redeemed before six months from the business day following the day of purchase. However, redeeming time deposits or certificates of deposit (CDs) prior to maturity either fully or partially results in a partial loss of interest.

### Return

Certificates of deposit (CDs) offer higher interest rates than time deposits.

### Liquidity

Time deposits offer higher liquidity than certificates of deposit (CDs) as funds can be withdrawn at any time, whereas funds deposited in certificates of deposit (CDs) cannot be withdrawn before six months from the business day following the day of purchase. However, redeeming time deposits or certificates of deposit (CDs) prior to maturity either fully or partially results in a partial loss of interest.
